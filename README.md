# UFOs

## Overview:

The original goal of this project was to create an interactive webpage about UFOs.  Our client, Dana, was driven to pursue this pet project based on a story from her home town about a UFO sighting by a farmer in 1950.   Dana wants a page that contains her story and allows readers to parse the data she has accumulated around UFO sightings.   To do that, we built a webpage that will allow users to view the story, filter the data present it in a dynamic table.

Farmer Trent in 1950

## Results:

Visitors to the page will be enticed to read the story and sort the data by the teaser header “the truth is out there”.  Those enticed enough to realize the truth is just below this Pulitzer prize winning title will wade thru additional tabloid verbiage to get a chance to decide for themselves by filtering the data in 5 different ways.
If you leave the filters empty, the entire data table is available for casual scrolling.

However, for the more efficiently minded peruser of this data set, filters are available to refine the experience.

Additional filtering further narrow the search in a reductive way allowing the user a more refined experience.

## Summary:

The project itself is somewhat barebones and could be embellished and updated to incorporate several items that would enhance its usability, attractiveness and profitability.
The filter design could be enhanced with the following additions:
A critical drawback of this page design is the usability of the filter input boxes.   The following suggetions should be seriously considered to increase the user experience.

1.	Drop down menus for choices.  Currently there is no way to tell what shape to enter, users could enter myriad shapes and get no hits.   A drop down would entice users and help guide there search with a minimum of frustration.

2.	The addition of a "Clear Filter(s)" button would be very helpful

3.	The alignment of the filter input boxes is not correct, the sloppiness detracts from the page layout.

4.	A wildcard option for multi word names would be helpful , currently you have to type “el cajon’ to have it returned, it won’t be returned if you just type in “el”.  

5.	Pop up instructions would be nice when you hover over the filter boxes

These additional enhancements would create a better experience for the user, increase traffic and ultimately with the addition of advertisements and merchandise options, increase profits for Dana.
